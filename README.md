# IPv4 Validation Function

## Overview
This project contains a function `isIpCorrect(ipAddress: String): Boolean` that validates whether a given IP address is a valid IPv4 address. The function checks the format and values of the IP address.

---

## Function Description
- Each segment must be a number between 0 and 255, inclusive.
- Leading zeros in any segment (e.g., "01" or "001") are not allowed, except for the digit "0" itself.
- The address must contain exactly three dots and no extra characters.
- The function should return a Boolean value onlyâ€”true if the input is a valid IPv4 address, and false otherwise.
